# 2. Kubernetes Learning Notes

---

## 🧪 Local Development Tools

- Skaffold: CLI tool that handles the build, push, and deploy loop for Kubernetes applications. It watches source code and automatically deploys updates.
- Buildpacks (buildpacks.io): Framework to transform application source code into container images without writing Dockerfiles.

---

## 🏗️ Kubernetes Architecture

### 🧩 Master Node Components

These coordinate the entire cluster:

- API Server

  - Entry point to the Kubernetes control plane.
  - Accepts RESTful commands (`kubectl`, clients).
  - Validates and processes resource definitions (Deployments, Pods, etc.).

- Scheduler

  - Assigns newly created Pods to suitable Nodes.
  - Considers resource availability, affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations.

- Controller Manager

  - Runs all controller processes (e.g., Node Controller, Job Controller, etc.).
  - Continuously reconciles desired and current states.

- etcd

  - Key-value store for all cluster data (state, configs, secrets).
  - Highly consistent; critical to cluster health.

---

### 🧱 Node Components

#### 📦 Worker Node (a.k.a. Minion)

Hosts and runs application workloads:

- kubelet

  - Agent on each Node.
  - Receives Pod specs from API Server and manages container lifecycle.
  - Registers Node to the cluster.
  - Reports health/status to the control plane.

- Container Runtime

  - Responsible for running containers (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker).

- kube-proxy

  - Manages network rules on each Node.
  - Forwards traffic to correct Pods.
  - Supports TCP/UDP load balancing.

- Pod Network

  - Every Pod gets a unique IP.
  - Implemented via network plugins like Flannel, Calico, Weave, etc.

## 🧠 Core Kubernetes Objects & Concepts

### 🎯 Pod

- Smallest unit of deployment in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates one or more containers with:

  - Shared storage (Volumes).
  - Shared network namespace (same IP/Port).
  - Shared lifecycle (created and destroyed together).

- Pods are ephemeral. Avoid relying on their IPs.

### ⚙️ Controllers

Ensure system always moves toward desired state.

#### Types of Controllers

1. Deployment

   - For stateless applications.
   - Manages rollout and rollback of changes.

2. ReplicaSet

   - Maintains a stable set of replica Pods.
   - Used by Deployments to manage Pods.

3. StatefulSet

   - For stateful applications (e.g., databases).
   - Ensures predictable Pod names and startup order.

4. DaemonSet

   - Runs a copy of a Pod on every Node.
   - Used for logging, monitoring, and networking daemons.

5. Job

   - Creates one or more Pods to run a task and terminate after success.
   - Parameters like `parallelism`, `completions` manage execution strategy.

6. CronJob

   - Similar to `Job`, but scheduled to run at specified intervals (like Unix cron).

### 🕸️ Services

Abstract way to expose applications running as Pods.

- ClusterIP (default): Internal cluster communication.
- NodePort: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
- LoadBalancer: Provisions external load balancer via cloud provider.
- ExternalName: Maps service name to an external DNS name.

🧠 _Services select Pods using `labels` and `selectors`._

---

### 🌐 DNS & Networking

- Kube DNS / CoreDNS: Cluster-wide DNS system.
- Each Pod is pre-configured with DNS resolver pointing to the cluster DNS service.
- Helps with service discovery (e.g., `myservice.mynamespace.svc.cluster.local`).

---

### 📦 Namespaces

- Logical partitioning of cluster resources.
- Useful for multi-tenant environments and resource isolation.
- Common built-in Namespaces:

  - `default`
  - `kube-system`
  - `kube-public`
  - `kube-node-lease`

---

### 🛠️ Volumes & Persistent Storage

- EmptyDir: Temporary storage for a Pod’s lifetime.
- hostPath: Mounts file from host Node.
- PersistentVolume (PV) and PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):

  - Abstractions for dynamic storage provisioning.
  - Enables separation of storage from Pods.

- StorageClass: Specifies storage types (e.g., SSD, HDD) and provisioners.

## 🔁 Kubernetes Lifecycle Example: Deploying `httpd-app`

### Scenario: Deploy `httpd-app` with 2 replicas

1. User executes: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
2. API Server receives request, stores spec in `etcd`.
3. Controller Manager creates a `Deployment` → which spawns a `ReplicaSet` → which creates 2 `Pods`.
4. Scheduler assigns Pods to Nodes (e.g., `k8s-node1`, `k8s-node2`).
5. kubelet on each Node starts containers as per spec.
6. Flannel (CNI) assigns IPs to Pods.
7. No Service defined yet, so kube-proxy is idle.

---

## 📊 Key Features & Best Practices

### 🔁 Self-Healing

- Kubernetes replaces failed Pods automatically.
- Controller ensures desired state matches real state.

### 🔄 Rolling Updates

- Controlled updates via `maxSurge`, `maxUnavailable`.
- Use `--record` to track Deployment versions and allow rollback.

### 🚫 Avoid Direct Pod IP Use

- Pod IPs change frequently.
- Always access Pods via Services or Ingress.

## 🧠 Additional Concepts

- Labels & Selectors: Metadata for grouping and querying Kubernetes objects.
- Taints & Tolerations: Control Pod scheduling based on Node constraints.
- Affinity/Anti-Affinity: Influences Pod co-location or separation.
- Resource Limits/Requests: Define CPU/memory usage guarantees and limits.
- Ingress: Layer 7 HTTP routing to expose Services with path-based or host-based rules.
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Scales Pods based on CPU/memory usage or custom metrics.
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRD): Allows extending Kubernetes with new resource types.
